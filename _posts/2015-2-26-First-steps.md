As you can see it's been a long time between posts. There were a lot going on, but my main excuse was fear of publication. That I don't have time to proper investigate some topic, that will be valuable enough to show it to the world. Also english is not my native language and that was also my worry. But time passed and I realized, that I've wasted time, because even if I had started poorly in every aspect, till today I will probably get over with this premature problems. But I didn't do this. 

So today I'm trying again. There are some changes in my live that should motivate me. I've started working in company that not only supports, but even encourages theirs employees to develop them selfs and I like it very much.

My goal is to put at least one blog post every week. At the beginning I presume that posts will be something like my notes from my everyday battlefield. Solutions to problems that I solve everyday. Also I want to put here something like library to valuable IMHO content that I read in web. For the .NET world the best site with this idea is [The morning brew](http://blog.cwa.me.uk/). The well brewed set of link serves to you at every morning (at least at England).
