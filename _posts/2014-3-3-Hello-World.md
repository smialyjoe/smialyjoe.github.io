Soooo, I've set up my Jekyll based blog and probably my first personal website. Not much here now, but it will change.

This page was created thanks to this [great ready to go, Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [instructions in this article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)!
